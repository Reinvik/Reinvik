# Hi there, I'm Ariel Mella 👋
**🏭 Lead Operations Engineer | Full Stack Developer | Lean Consultant**
*Bridging the gap between the "Gemba" and deployed Code.*
I am a unique hybrid: a Lean Engineer who lives in the operation to spot real inefficiencies and a Full Stack Developer who builds the solutions to fix them. I don't just write software; I architect ecosystems that eliminate waste, digitize manual workflows, and optimize logistic chains.
